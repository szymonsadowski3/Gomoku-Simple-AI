# GOMOKU AI

This project is an attempt to make simple AI capable of playing Gomoku game.

## Requirements

This project was developed with Stack (https://www.haskellstack.org/). Other prerequisites are listed in .cabal file. While building project, stack should install them automatically.

### Prerequisites

Current listing from cabal file: 

```
split, universe-base, process
```

### Installing

```
git clone 
cd Gomoku
stack build
stack exec Gomoku-exe
```
### Important notes

Playing Gomoku on 19x19 board is very computationally-expensive, so please be patient while waiting for AI's next move :P
